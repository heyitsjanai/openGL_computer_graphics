# cs330_graphics
SNHU CS 330: Computer Graphics and Visualizations projects, along with milestones and other work within OpenGL. Using Modern OpenGL, GLEW, GLAD, and GLFW libraries, rendering 2D and 3D objects. C++ in Visual Studios.


The final project is named CS330_modFiveMilestone. I created a scene using simple 3D shapes to replicate the following picture:

Since I was brand new to OpenGL or any graphics API, I had to learn from scratch how to create a simple window before moving on 
to rendering other objects within a window. I learned as I went, but ultimately, LearnOpenGL.com was the primary resource used
in this project. As I now know how to do the basic graphic design, in the future, I will not have to start from scratch. I will
be using the knowledge gained here (window creation, input capture, multiple object rendering, textures and lighting) as a starting
point to create something unique and maybe something brand new! Although simple objects are all I have experience with rendering, 
a lot of complex objects can be made using multiple objects. 

Since I was learning from scratch, milestones and iteration were essential in the design of this 3D scene. With each object, getting it to render 
was the first step. Next was placement and scaling, followed by textures and lighting. Each new object came with its own challenges,
such as rotation along certain axes, correct texture coordinates, and normalization of lighting. The milestones created along the way were essential 
in delivering this final product.

More complex objects, working with other available libraries and directories, and exploring other graphics APIs are all next steps. I can take
these skills to render anything I put my mind to. I also have more experience in VStudios, linking external dependencies, and how project and solution
directories should be set up. All of these skills can help to further a job in software development. Here is a screenshot of the final scene created
with Modern OpenGL:
